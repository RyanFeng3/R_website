	<h3> Story about RMA history </h3>
	<p>  Real Madrid C.F. are a professional football club based in Madrid, Spain. In addition to their domestic success, Real Madrid's reputation as a major club was established by their outstanding record in the European Cup. To date, they have been crowned champions of Europe a record thirteen times. Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás and other famous players helped the club win the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the memorable 7–3 Hampden Park final against German side Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960. The club won for a sixth time in 1966 with the team known as the Ye-Ye defeated Yugoslavian club Partizan 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of Spanish-born players, a first in the competition. They were also runners-up in 1962, 1964 and 1981. Winning the competition five consecutive times saw Real permanently awarded the original cup and earning the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour. They have also won the UEFA Cup twice and were twice runners-up in the European Cup Winners Cup.</p>

	<li> Football was introduced to Spain by students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. They included several Oxbridge graduates. In 1897, they founded a club called Sky, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, they split into two different clubs: New Foot-Ball de Madrid and Madrid Football Club. On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded and won the first of four consecutive Copa del Rey titles, which was the only nationwide competition at that time.</li>
	<li> Real Madrid have once again defined an era in world football, winning four European Cups. In 2014, they lifted La Décima, before winning the Club World Cup that same year. Zidane's first two seasons in the dugout were historic, clinching La Undécima and La Duodécima. What's more, 2017 became a record-breaking year when the team got their hands on five trophies: The European Cup, the Club World Cup, LaLiga and the European and Spanish Super Cups. La Decimotercera then came in 2018, when they came out on top against Liverpool in Kiev.</li>

In 1912, they moved to a ground called Campo de O'Donnell, after previously moving between some minor grounds. In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII, a reputed football fan, granted the title of real ("royal" in English ) to the club. When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, however, the club dropped both the word Real and the royal crown from the emblem, being known from then on and until the end of the Spanish Civil War as Madrid C.F. only. The addition of the purple band to the emblem dates back to the Republican period and has remained there ever since. In 1937, due to the stagnation of the Civil War, all activity was stopped and the club virtually ceased to exist.

The 2005–06 season began with several new signings, including Júlio Baptista (€20 million), Robinho (€30 million) and Sergio Ramos (€30 million). However, Luxemburgo was not able to find the right formula on the pitch, as Real Madrid's poor form continued and hitting rock bottom after a humiliating 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Bernabéu. Luxemburgo would eventually resign and be replaced by Juan Ramón López Caro, the former the manager of Real Madrid Castilla. A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after losing the first leg of the Copa del Rey quarter-final 6–1 to Zaragoza. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time by Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned as club president.[5] Real Madrid eventually managed to finish second in the league but did not pose a serious threat to defending champions Barcelona.

After no one of the 2009 presidency election was able to get the necessary funds (€56 million), on 1 June, Florentino Pérez was officially announced as Real Madrid's new president. His first move was to sign Brazilian superstar Kaká from Milan for an undisclosed fee, though believed to be £56 million (€68M).[8] On 11 June 2009, Real Madrid officially announced on their website that an £80 million (€94M) offer for Portuguese Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo had been accepted by his club, Manchester United, after the player had expressed his desire to leave the club for Los Merengues. On 25 June, Raúl Albiol joined Real Madrid from Valencia on a fee thought to be in the region of €15 million. On 26 June, the deal for Ronaldo was finalized, with the player becoming officially a Real Madrid player on 1 July.

On 3 June 2017, Madrid won the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final 4–1 against Juventus, with two goals from Ronaldo and goals from Casemiro and Asensio, to win their second consecutive and twelfth overall title. With that win, Madrid became the first team to defend their title in the Champions League era.
